# clickerRPG
An RPG based around an overworld, random dungeons, and a new method of fighting monsters.

###Planned additions (in some way, shape, or form)
* Levels and stats. Attack, defense, speed, and hit points.
* Power ups, perhaps buyable. Stuff to customize battles, give advantages, etc. Each advantage must come with a disadvantage.
* "Bonus" items that are possibly buyable
* A static overworld map that can be explored.
* Randomly generated, rogue-style dungeons
* Classes and possibly subclasses
* Possibly an encyclopedia of monsters
* Payable content, probably in the form of extra dungeons, loot, and easy leveling and/or boss battles
